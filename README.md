# Flappy Bird Game

This is a simple Flappy Bird game implemented in Python using the Pygame library.

## How to Play

- Use your mouse to control the bird's flight. Left-click to make the bird flap its wings and fly higher.
- Avoid hitting the pipes and the ground.
- Try to pass through the gaps between the pipes to earn points.
- If you crash into a pipe or the ground, the game is over. You can restart by clicking the "Restart" button.

## Installation

To run the game, you need to have Python and Pygame installed on your system. If you don't have Pygame installed, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

You also need to download the game assets, including the background, ground, bird, and pipe images. Make sure to place these images in a directory called "img" within the same folder as the game code.

## Running the Game

To run the game, execute the following command:

```bash
python your_game_filename.py
```

Replace `your_game_filename.py` with the name of the Python file containing the game code.

## Controls

- Left-click: Flap the bird's wings to make it fly higher.
- Close the game window to exit.

## Game Logic

- The game starts with the bird at the center of the screen.
- Pipes of varying heights will appear from the right side of the screen and move from right to left.
- The player must navigate the bird through the gaps between the pipes to earn points.
- If the bird collides with a pipe or the ground, the game is over.
- The player can restart the game by clicking the "Restart" button.

## Game Features

- Scrolling background and ground for a dynamic environment.
- Realistic bird animation with wing flapping.
- Randomly generated pipe positions and heights.
- Score tracking and display.

Have fun playing Flappy Bird!
